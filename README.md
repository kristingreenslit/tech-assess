Hello! My name is Kristin and I’m a web developer with a background in tech support.

TechAssess is is an open source project that was built for the individual computer user. It is a tool that people can use to learn more about basic computer maintenance and improve their digital lives. It’s been my experience that many people do not intend to be careless about protecting their data, it’s that technology is not simple - and the average computer user doesn’t know how to go about finding information or what information to trust.

Thanks and happy assessing!
