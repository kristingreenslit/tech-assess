## Project Workflow
Don't see any evidence of Project Workflow reflected in your repository. Does not meet expectations. However, I imagine you did a decent amount of planning for this project

## Technical Requirements
Your applications has 2 models with CRUD and 1 model on its way. It also has a couple of associations. Great job! Meets Expectations.

## Creativity / Interface
- I would incorporate in your code a way so that a user has to be authenticated. Otherwise the page will error out. Currently there isn't a way to access the login/signup. I had to manually enter the URL from knowing the rake route. I do like the simplicity and overall design. I also really enjoyed taking the quiz! Meets Expectations.

## Code Quality
You've actually got another techasses rails application inside of your folder. Probably an empty rails application. I would get rid of that as soon as possible, lots of files you don't need. Otherwise, code looks properly indented. I would recommend putting more comments in your code, future kristin will be happier with past kristin. Meets Expectations.

## Deployment and Functionality
Your app is deployed to heroku. It seems its even further along than my forked version! Meets expectations.

## Overall.

Meets Expectations. You did a great job on this project. Matt did inform me that he helped you a decent amount during this project. I just want to make sure that you understand everything that he taught you. I think you're super close to getting assessments to work. Quiz functionality tends to be quite difficult to program. Lots of money to be made in programming quizzes i imagine. Great job!
