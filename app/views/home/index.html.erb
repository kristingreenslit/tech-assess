  <p> Tech Assess is an open source project that was built for the individual computer user.</p>
  <p>A computer is a machine. Simliar to a car, it needs maintenance so that it can live a long life and operate without problems.</p>
  <p>For computers, there is an additional benefit to keeping up with routine maintenance. In many cases personal information could be better protected if individual computer users performed a few simple maintenace steps every once in a while.</p>
